# Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
##1. What is linear regression? What is logistic regression? What is the difference?
* Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables, and it is used for solving Regression problem.In Linear regression, we predict the value of continuous variables. Least square estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.
* Logistic Regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables, and it is used for solving classification problem.In logistic Regression, we predict the values of categorical variables.Maximum likelihood estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.
