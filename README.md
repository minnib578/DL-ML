# Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
1. What is linear regression? What is logistic regression? What is the difference?
* Linear regression is used to predict the continuous dependent variable using a given set of independent variables, and it is used for solving Regression problem.In Linear regression, we predict the value of continuous variables. Least square estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.

* Logistic Regression is used to predict the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables, and it is used for solving classification problem.In logistic Regression, we predict the values of categorical variables.Maximum likelihood estimation method is used for estimation of accuracy.The output of Logistic Regression problem can be only between the 0 and 1.In logistic regression, we pass the weighted sum of inputs through an activation function that can map values in between 0 and 1. Such activation function is known as sigmoid function and the curve obtained is called as sigmoid curve.
